## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hannah Ragudos

I'm a Computer Science student from **Saint Louis University**, a filmmaker, and an aspiring software developer. I focus on **UI/UX design** and **frontend development** â€” building interfaces that are clean, intuitive, and purposeful.

### Interests

I'm especially interested in UI/UX research, where I explore how people interact with systems and how thoughtful design can shape their experiences. Iâ€™m drawn to user-centered design, creating digital products that are rooted in empathy, accessibility, and real human needs. I also have a growing curiosity in artificial intelligence, particularly how it can enhance user interfaces, personalize experiences, and improve overall usability. Lastly, I enjoy working with design systems and interaction design, building consistent, scalable, and engaging design patterns across digital platforms.

### ðŸŽ¬ On the Side

When Iâ€™m not coding or designing, I enjoy filmmaking as a creative outlet.  
Iâ€™ve directed short films, produced video presentations, and participated in film festivals as a **Film Ambassador for the FDCP**.  
Storytelling through film helps me approach design with emotion, intention, and human focus.
